# DSA Learning Journey with C++

This repository is a personal collection of my learnings, practice, and progress in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. Here, I regularly update solutions to classic problems, implement core algorithms, and experiment with different approaches as I deepen my understanding of DSA concepts.

## 📚 What You'll Find

- **Topic-wise Folders:**
  - Arrays, searching, sorting, patterns, functions, and more.
  - Each folder contains C++ files focused on a specific DSA topic or problem type.
- **Standalone Problems:**
  - Solutions to popular coding problems and algorithmic challenges.
- **Practice & Experimentation:**
  - Code snippets, practice questions, and experimental implementations as I learn new concepts.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure (Examples)

- `arrays/` – Array operations, searching, subarrays, 2D arrays, etc.
- `basics/` – Fundamental C++ and math problems (primes, factorial, palindrome, etc.)
- `binary search/` – Binary search and its applications.
- `functions/` – Utility and helper functions.
- `patterns/` – Pattern printing problems.
- `sorting Algorithms/` – Sorting techniques (bubble, insertion, selection, etc.)
- Standalone files for specific problems (e.g., `stockBuySell.cpp`, `sieveOfEratosthenes.cpp`).

## 🚀 How to Use

- Browse folders to explore my DSA journey and solutions.
- Compile any `.cpp` file using:
  ```bash
  g++ path/to/file.cpp -o output
  ./output
  ```
- Use the code as reference for your own learning or practice.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is a personal learning space, but suggestions, improvements, or discussions are always welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have ideas to share.

## 📅 Progress

I update this repository as I learn new topics, solve new problems, or revisit old ones for better solutions. It's a living record of my growth in DSA with C++.

Happy Learning & Coding!
